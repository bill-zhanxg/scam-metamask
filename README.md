# MetaMask Scam email deobfuscated

This is a deobfuscated version of a scam email that was sent to me. The email was sent from a fake MetaMask email address and was trying to get me to enter my seed phrase into a fake MetaMask website.
I got annoyed by how many emails I was getting from scammers, so I decided to deobfuscate this one and see what it was trying to do.
It's funny how the scammers left their bot's token in the code, so I created two scripts to spam their bot with fake data. Therefor it might save some people from getting scammed.
